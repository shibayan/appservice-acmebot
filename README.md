### 4. Assign roles to target resource group

Using `Access control (IAM)`, assign a role to Function App. Require `Website Contributor` and `Web Plan Contributor` roles.

![Assign a role](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1356444/43694372-feaefda4-996d-11e8-9ee5-e58254ec05f5.png)

![IAM settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1356444/44624857-e169c900-a934-11e8-982c-5ad8c163beff.png)

**Remarks**

If the Web App refers to a Service Plan in a different resource group, Please assign `Website Contributor` role for Resource Group with Web App and `Web Plan Contributor` role for Resource Group with Service Plan.

## Usage

### Adding new certificate

Go to `https://YOUR-FUNCTIONS.azurewebsites.net/add-certificate`. Since the Web UI is displayed, if you select the target App Service and domain and execute it, a certificate will be issued.

![Add certificate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1356444/49693421-b3dc1f00-fbb5-11e8-8ac1-37092a2be711.png)

If nothing is displayed in the dropdown, the IAM setting is incorrect.

### Adding wildcard certificate or Linux Container support

If they need a Wildcard certificate, additional assign `DNS Zone Contributor` role to Azure DNS or Resource group.

![IAM settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1356444/44642883-3840d280-aa09-11e8-9346-faa26f9675af.png)

Certificates for "App Service on Linux" and "Web App for Container" is required Azure DNS.

### Renew certificates

This function will check the expiration date once a day for the certificate issuer is `Let's Encrypt Authority X3` or `Let's Encrypt Authority X4`.

The default time is UTC 00:00, so if necessary they can set any time zone with `WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE`.

### Deploy new version

This function use `Run From Package`. To deploy the latest version, just restart Azure Functions.

## Troubleshooting

**Causes Azure REST API error at GetSite or Dns01Precondition**

Make sure that the required role is assign for the resource group. Azure IAM may take up to 30 minutes to be reflected.
